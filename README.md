## CSC 435 Programming Assignment 3 (Fall 2024)
**Jarvis College of Computing and Digital Media - DePaul University**

**Student:** Reyna Royce  
**Email:** rroyce@depaul.edu  
**Solution Programming Language:** C++

## What This Program Does


This project implements a multithreaded file retrieval engine that indexes text files in an input folder and performs search operations over the indexed data. The program supports the following:

- Multithreading for parallel indexing of files to improve the indexing performance.
- Indexing a directory and reading files within it.
- Searching for terms within indexed files, supporting both single-term queries and AND-based multiple term queries.
- Displays the time taken for indexing and search operations, along with the total bytes read.

#### A Few Points to Consider:

- The number of worker threads can be specified via a command-line argument when executing the program.
- The multithreading implementation uses a thread-safe queue to coordinate work among the threads.
- Search functionality is **case-sensitive** and supports multi-term search using "AND" to find documents containing all the queried words.
- The engine processes only alphanumeric characters and ignores short words (length ≤ 2).
- if the search query is expressed with an AND query, the result will contain all the documents that contain **all** the terms from the AND query. 
- The results are sorted by the number of accumulated occurrences of all terms in each document, and only the top 10 documents are printed. 
- Validations are present in the program, so in the case of the below scenarios the progarm will print the appropriate messages to the user. 
    - No/invalid/negative thread count provided
    - Invalid Folder path
    - Folder does not exists
    - No folder path specifid
    - Missing search terms

#### The program also assumes that your enviroment already has the following installed and configured:

- GCC 14 C++ Compiler
- CMake (For generating build files)
- Git


## Folder and File Structure
The repository follows the below given folder and file structure:

```
CSC-435-PA3
├── app-cpp/
│   ├── include/
│   │   ├── AppInterface.hpp
│   │   ├── IndexStore.hpp
│   │   ├── ProcessingEngine.hpp

## How to build and run the program

### 1. Creating the `build/` Directory 

For creating the build folder, navigate to the `app-cpp` folder and create the build folder by using the command below. This folder will contain the build files generated by CMake.

```` 
cd app-cpp
mkdir build
````

### 2. Run CMake commands to intiate the Build process

Navigate into the `build/` directory and run CMake commands to intialise the project.

````
cd build
cmake ..
````

### 3. Build the program

Navigate back into the `app-cpp` folder of the reposiory and run the build commands. 

```
cd ..
cmake --build build/
```

### 4. Execute the program

Once the build is complete, run the program with the following command from the app-cpp directory. The number of worker threads can be specified as a command-line argument.

```
./build/file-retrieval-engine <num_worker_threads>
```

- `<num_worker_threads>` is the the number of worker threads to be used for indexing. If not specified, the program will display an error.

#### Example:

The below given command will execute the program using 4 worker threads.

```
./build/file-retrieval-engine 4
```


#### Example:

```
./build/file-retrieval-engine 4
> <index | search | quit>  index ../../datasets/dataset1
